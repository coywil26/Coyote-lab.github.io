description: "Daniel was a graduate student at Duke University with Jane and David Richardson, where he studied protein flexibility in structure validation, prediction, and design. In the Fraser lab, he will develop techniques to build multi-conformer structural models, extract functional cooperative conformational changes, and engineer allosteric/drug-sensitive proteins.


Daniel is supported by a fellowship from the A.P. Giannini Foundation."
