description: "Jen completed her undergraduate degree at Boston University in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology where she studied neurobiology of female rat reproduction under Dr. Mary Erskine. She went on to work as a lab supervisor and in the algae biofuels industry before returning to academia to pursue her Ph.D. at UC San Diego in the lab of Dr. Michael Burkart. In his lab she worked on diverse projects ranging from the use of biochemical probes to understand protein-protein interactions in fatty acid and polyketide synthases to various approaches including metagenomics to explore the biochemical influences on marine atmospheric composition.

In the Fraser lab she seeks to utilize computational approaches to enable high-throughput experiments through automation and pipeline development."
