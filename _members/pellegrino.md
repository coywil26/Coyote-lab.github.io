description: "Jenna graduated from Ursinus College with degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and in French. While an undergrad, she studied the structure-function relationships of diiron carboxylate enzymes rubrerythrin and symerythrin using the de novo G4DFsc protein model system under the guidance of Dr. Amanda Reig.


Now at UCSF, she studies the interactions between streptogramin antibiotics and the ribosome. When sheâ€™s not in the lab, Jenna enjoys climbing, reading, playing squash, and gaming.


Jenna is supported by a graduate fellowship from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/)."
