description: "Hector graduated from Rice University with a degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Under the guidance of Dr. George Phillips, he studied the kinetics of BlaC, an enzyme that confers on bacterial pathogens a resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. As an [HHMI EXROP](https://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/exceptional-research-opportunities-program-exrop/) fellow, he studied antibody affinity maturation in the Harrison lab at HMS.


His research at UCSF will focus on characterizing ribosomal protection proteins, in complex with the ribosome, using cryo-electron microscopy. When not in the lab, Hector enjoys hiking, exploring beaches, and Latin dance."
