description: "Joey graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Biochemistry. He received his PhD in Biochemistry and Cell Biology from Rice University. As a graduate student with George Phillips, his thesis work involved method development of mix-and-inject serial crystallography for structural enzymology using X-ray free electron lasers.

Joey joined the Fraser Lab in June 2020. When he’s not in lab, Joey enjoys discovering new music, reading, and going on long walks around the city.
