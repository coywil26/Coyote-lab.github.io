description: "Robbie graduated from the University of Miami with a degree in Neuroscience. He studied how transcription factors regulate axon regeneration in the central nervous system as an undergraduate in Dr. Vance Lemmon's lab.


Robbie is interested in utilizing single-molecule and structural techniques to study interactions between chitin-binding proteins and chitin. When he's not in lab, Robbie enjoys reading, going to museums, and biking around the city.


Robbie is supported by graduate fellowships from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [HHMI](http://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/gilliam-fellowships-advanced-study/)."
