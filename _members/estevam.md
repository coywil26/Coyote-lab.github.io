description: "Gabby graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. As an undergraduate, she studied the structure and dynamics of telomeres and telomerase under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Stone, where her focus was on developing a high-throughput platform to study telomere lengthening.


In the Fraser Lab, Gabby is interested in studying the allosteric regulation of kinase activity through molecular and structural biology. Outside of lab, she enjoys exploring nature and tries her best to longboard."
