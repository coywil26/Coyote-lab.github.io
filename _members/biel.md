description: "Justin graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Biochemistry and Biophysics. He conducted research in both the laboratories of Dr. Elisar Barbar studying dynein protein interactions, and Dr. P. Andrew Karplus conducting structural bioinformatic research on protein structural components from ultra-high resolution protein crystal structures.


As a graduate student  in the Fraser lab, he examined the how conformational heterogeneity changed during directed evolution and revealed minor states that resulted from ligand binding. He was supported by a graduate fellowship from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/).


As a staff scientist, he is now building up capabilities for high-throughput ligand soaking experiments."
