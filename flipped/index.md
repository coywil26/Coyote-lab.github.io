#Engineering Life:  A Flipped Classroom with iBiology#

##Spring 2015 Syllabus##

**Course Days/Hours:** 3pm-5pm on May 15, 18, 20, 22, 26, 27, 29

**Location:** Genentech Hall S201

**Instructors:** [Ron Vale](Ron.Vale@ucsf.edu) and [James Fraser](jfraser@fraserlab.com);

**Course Description:**

How did life evolve?  How can understand the principles of biological systems to create new proteins, new chemicals, biological structures, cells and tissues?  We will cover these topics in a "flipped course" where you will hear online lectures from scientific leaders in the field, read a paper, and then discuss as a group.  We have chosen diverse topics within this subject area, since they provide a window into how scientists tackle problems using different approaches.  We will meet for 7 sessions.  Prior to each session, students and faculty will view the three parts of an iBiology talk (usually 3 x ~30 min segments) and read one research paper from the speaker which is also discussed in the talk.  For the first session, two talks are assigned (they can be viewed at anytime prior to the course, as is true also of the other lectures).  A series of prompt questions will be prepared to help guide student-faculty discussion as a group.  One student and faculty member will be assigned as a discussion leader, but all students will be expected to be well prepared to engage in the discussion.
