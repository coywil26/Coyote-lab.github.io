# Our research

#### Identifying hidden alternative conformations of proteins in biophysical data

We study proteins as conformational ensembles.
Although X-ray crystallography is an ensemble experiment, the results are typically summarized with a single static structure.
As a graduate student, and now in my own lab, we have developed software to discover the structural ensembles present in the crystal.
The ensemble nature of proteins highlighted by this work feeds into all of our mechanistic studies that interpret the functional effects of mutations, that characterize designed and artificially-evolved proteins, or that seek to modulate protein function with small molecules.
We are expanding this direction to include modeling and validating protein structural data generated by cryoelectron microscopy (using EMRinger and ensemble modeling) and through integrative approaches to discover cryptic sites.

#### Creating multi-temperature X-ray data collection methods to inform mechanistic studies

We recognized that the standard practice of cryocooling crystals could distort protein conformations.
In both larger surveys and isolated mechanistic studies, we have demonstrated the value of room temperature data collection for revealing the structural basis of protein conformational dynamics, leading to new insights into the enzymes PTP1B, CypA, H-Ras, and DHFR, and increasing connections to dynamics studies from NMR and simulations.
Additionally, we have identified how temperature can bias small molecule discovery, leading some fragment sites inaccessible at cryogenic temperatures, and the positioning of crucial water molecules in the flu ion channel M2.

#### Developing new X-ray diffuse and time-resolved scattering experiments to probe correlated motions in proteins

A major limitation of most biophysical techniques is the inability to directly reveal correlations in motions between distinct regions of macromolecules.
Diffuse scattering has the potential to reveal these motions; however, we currently lack the ability to collect, integrate, and refine diffuse scattering data.
We are tackling each of these problems directly with collaborators: Michael Wall, Nicholas Sauter, Tom Terwilliger, and Paul Adams.
Our long-term goal is to increase the information content of every X-ray diffraction experiment to reveal atomic level coupling at high resolution and improved models of grouped flexibility at low resolution.
We are also taking advantage of the new capabilities of next-generation X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL) light sources to perform radiation damage-free imaging of proteins and to watch how protein ensembles respond when perturbed by rapid temperature jumps using the X-FEL.

#### Determining structures that influence microbial-host interactions

I have a longstanding interest in microbiology, beginning from my undergraduate work with Alan Davidson (Toronto) on bacteriophage structure prediction that lead to the surprising discovery of a class of mobile immunoglobulin domains.
I have collaborated with the Zusman lab (UC Berkeley) to determine the structure of FrzS, a key signaling regulator of Myxococcus xanthus, with the Fischbach lab (Stanford) to determine how the gut microbiome produces the neurotransmitter tryptamine, and with the Tawfik lab (Weizmann Institute, Israel) to determine the role of epistasis in restricting antibiotic resistance mutations.
We are expanding this interest to include the interaction of human enzymes in degrading chitin molecules that can cause inflammation in the context of allergy and asthma, the hijacking of the proline isomerase CypA in lentiviral evolution, and structure-based antibiotic design using cryoEM.

#### Identifying unifying concepts between systems and structural biology

With Nevan Krogan, we have articulated the similarities in genetic epistasis and thermodynamic measurements and applied these insights to large-scale studies of point mutants and posttranslational modifications.
This framework forms the basis for the UCSF graduate course that I direct, PUBS (Physical Underpinnings of Biological Systems), which uses deep sequencing to determine the context dependence of fitness effects of mutations.
The class is taught through project-based learning where incoming students perform all library preparations, load samples directly on the MiSeq, and write all their own code to process sequencing data.
