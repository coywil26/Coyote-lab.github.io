# Fraser Lab Lab Courses

The Fraser lab is supportive of learning through research experiences, and has participated in a number of courses for first year graduate students which challenge students with real research challenges in which they conduct experiments and analyze data to answer interesting new questions.

## Biophysics 204A: Macromolecular Methods


Fluency in multiple biophysical methods is often critical for answering mechanistic questions. To train the next generation of biophysicists at UCSF, we have decided to alter the traditional didactic structure by creating a new 6 week “Macromolecular Methods” class that places data collection at the beginning of the course.

## Biophysics 205A: Physical Underpinnings of Biological Systems (PUBS)

The PUBS course is a hands-on, project-based course that integrates proteomics, deep mutational profiling [(Fowler and Fields, _Nature Methods_, 2014)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075907), and computational biology.

##  Engineering Life:  A Flipped Classroom with iBiology

How did life evolve?  How can understand the principles of biological systems to create new proteins, new chemicals, biological structures, cells and tissues?  We will cover these topics in a "flipped course" where you will hear online lectures from scientific leaders in the field, read a paper, and then discuss as a group.  Tetrad minicourse.

##  Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance

This minicourse will be a survey of recent and classic papers on antibiotic resistance with an emphasis on evolutionary biology, biochemical mechanisms, and new ideas for chemical matter.  Tetrad minicourse.
