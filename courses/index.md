# Fraser Lab Lab Courses

The Fraser lab is supportive of learning through research experiences, and has participated in a number of courses for first year graduate students which challenge students with real research challenges in which they conduct experiments and analyze data to answer interesting new questions.


# Biophysics 205A: Physical Underpinnings of Biological Systems (PUBS)

The PUBS course is a hands-on, project-based course that integrates proteomics, deep mutational profiling [(Fowler and Fields, _Nature Methods_, 2014)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075907), and computational biology.
