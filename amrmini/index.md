# Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance

## Spring 2019 Syllabus

**Course Days/Hours:** 2pm-4pm on April 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17

**Location:** Genentech Hall S202

**Instructors:** [James Fraser](mailto:jfraser@fraserlab.com);

**Course Description:**

This minicourse will be a survey of recent and classic papers on antibiotic resistance with an emphasis on evolutionary biology, biochemical mechanisms, and new ideas for chemical matter.

## Course structure

Each students will serve as Discussion Leaders (pre-assigned below) for one paper topic.  Everyone should be prepared for class by having read the paper carefully. The Discussion Leader will prepare a talk similar in content and quality to a Tetrad or QBC Journal Club presentation, with an estimated 30-40 minute duration (noting that interruptions and discussion may take us closer to an hour).

**Introductory Lectures:** April 2nd [Danica Fujimori](http://fujimorilab.ucsf.edu/), April 3rd [Ian Seiple](http://seiplegroup.ucsf.edu/)
