A warm welcome to new UCSF [Faculty Fellow](fellows.ucsf.edu) Joe Bondy-Demony. Joe was a graduate student with Alan Davidson at University of Toronto, a lab I worked in as an undergraduate. [The Bondy-Demony Lab](bondydenomylab.ucsf.edu) builds on his groundbreaking discovery of naturally occuring anti-CRISPR proteins that antagonize the CRISPR systems that are all the rage in genomics. Welcome Joe!
