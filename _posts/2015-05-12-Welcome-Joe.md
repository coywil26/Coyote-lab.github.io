A warm welcome to new UCSF [Faculty Fellow](http://fellows.ucsf.edu) Joe Bondy-Demony. Joe was a graduate student with Alan Davidson at University of Toronto, which is also the lab that gave me a start in science as an undergraduate. [The Bondy-Demony Lab](http://bondydenomylab.ucsf.edu) builds on his groundbreaking discovery of naturally occurring anti-CRISPR proteins that antagonize the CRISPR systems that are all the rage in genomics. Welcome Joe!
